Atmospheric drawdown will rely on modeling. Pilot studies will try to do as many in situ measurements as possible, but at the end of day, models are needed.
We’ll be taking measurements using YSI EXO2 Sonde with temperature, salinity, pH/ORP, dissolved oxygen, total algae (chlorophyll a and blue green algae), and turbidity as well as a Turner C-sense pCO2 sensor. We plan on monitoring continuously in real-time near the discharge port, taking ~daily bottle samples to validate the sensors, and doing monthly sampling transects of the channel.

2.       Who does the measurement and who verifies it? Please provide the names of entities if possible
Measurements will be made by Limenet scientific staff and will be verified directly in the field by a third-party verification body RINA certification following validation of the MRV protocol.
3.       Which sensors are you using and do you own these or are they in-kind contributions from a partner you selected?
During monitoring, 4 typology of sensors are used to continuously monitor pH, turbidity, alkalinity and Total Inorganic Carbon. These are the main parameters used to monitor the storage technology. The instrumentation we use are purchased from an external partner which is Ecofluid s.r.l.
4. Do you use your own autonomous platform systems or are these in-kind contributions from a partner you selected? 
We have an internal system of accounting the CO2 out facility have removed. Those data, collected into a PLC, will then be verified by a third-party verification body: RINA certification.
4.       Who defines the methodology you are verifying by?
The verification and validation process for GHG emissions and the requirements for its accreditation are specified in ISO 14064-3:2006 and ISO 14065:2007.

O5. Assess the fate of organic and inorganic carbon released from the Sargassum, including the extent to which any recalcitrant carbon is retained within the sediment, the amount lost into the overlying water column, and the expected duration of its retention within seawater. 
O6. Advance our understanding of the efficacy, ecological and economic viability of sinking seaweed in deep marine environments as a marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) mechanism.
