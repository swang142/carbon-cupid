Key properties of these blooms, however, were influenced by Si. Photosynthetic capacity and nutrient use efficiency doubled from Si-poor to Si-rich upwelling, leading to C:N ratios as high as 17, well beyond Redfield. Si-rich upwelling also resulted in 6-fold higher diatom abundance and mineralized Si and a corresponding shift from smaller towards larger phytoplankton. The pronounced change in both plankton quantity (biomass) and quality (C:N ratio, size and mineral ballast) for trophic transfer and export underlines the pivotal role of Si in shaping the response of oligotrophic regions to upwelled nutrients.

Upwelling was simulated via two modes: i) a singular deep-water pulse and ii) a recurring supply every 4 days; each mode at four different intensities defined by the total amount of nitrate added which amounted 1.5, 3, 5.7, and 11 μmol L-1.",N/A,N/A,,Southern Cross University,Measurement-Internal,"Internal, covering over 45 physical, chemical and biological paramters.","Tanks or Mesocosms,Bottle samples,Underwater cameras,Dive teams","Total alkalinity,Dissolved inorganic carbon,Particulate inorganic carbon,Particulate organic carbon,Particulate organic nitrogen,Particulate organic phosphorus,Dissolved oxygen,Temperature,Salinity,Nutrients,Algal growth,Total algae,Phytoplankton,Chlorophyll-a,eDNA,Biological samples,Microbial analysis,""Species richness, evenness and diversity""","Primary production scaled linearly with upwelling intensity. Upwelling primarily benefitted larger phytoplankton size fractions, causing a shift from pico- and nano- to nano- and microphytoplankton. Recurring supply of upwelled waters generated higher efficiencies in primary production compared to single pulse addition. DOM accumulation increased with upwelling intensity, shifting DOM characteristics towards increased proportions of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and humic-like DOM, whereby the single upwelling pulse generated higher CDOM quantities with higher molecular weight. Carbon export under artificial upwelling more than doubled, and the molar C:N ratios of sinking organic matter increased from values around Redfield (6.6) to 8–13, which is beneficial for carbon dioxide removal. Sinking matter, however, was remineralized faster and had lower sinking velocities, which led to shallower remineralization depths. Particle properties were more favorable for deep carbon export in the recurring upwelling mode, while in the singular mode the C:N increase of sinking matter was more pronounced.",Subsequently to this mesocosm experiment we have conducted one further mesocosm study about the optimal Si:N ratio in artificially upwelled water in Gran Canaria and one free drifting wave pump test in 2022,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/27%C2%B055'40.4%22N+15%C2%B021'51.6%22W/@27.927888,-15.3669082,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d27.9278833!4d-15.3643333?entry=ttu",,,,27.9278889,-15.3643333,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.880550/full

LOC-NESS Trial 1: Tracking the movement of dye tracer to inform alkalinity dispersion,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,Research Institution,Mineral-Based Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement,Mineral-Based Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement,Concluded,09/2023,September 2023,Days,"This research will study the way in which an increase in alkalinity can potentially pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it safely.
The team will release nontoxic, fluorescent Rhodamine WT dye into the ocean from a research ship and track its movement through the water for 72 hours to model the dispersion of a plume of alkalinity over time. By releasing an environmentally safe red dye in the ocean, the research team can “label” a patch of water and determine how long that water stays at the surface and interacts with the atmosphere or mixes and sinks.
The reason the scientists are interested in how the dye disperses and how fast the dispersal occurs is because for alkalinity to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the alkaline material—which will be used in the second and third field experiments—has to be at the ocean surface.
Conducting a series of these field experiments off the northeast coast of the United States in waters above the continental shelf and slope will allow researchers to use this data to design the optimal combination of observational and modeling capabilities needed to safely deploy alkaline feedstock from a ship and to determine the atmospheric and environmental impacts of carbon dioxide removal via OAE.",N/A		,N/A,,"NOAA,Rutgers University,MBARI",Measurement-Internal,"Once released, the red dye is visible to the naked eye for several hours after the deployment, with small traces detectable by instruments for approximately 72 hours.

We will also be surveying the biological community and water chemistry, as background data for our later experiments.

Science
- Drying, spraying, and decaying biomass
    - actual process has increased in speed → biomass is dry within 4 minutes when sprayed into desert
    - at no point during process is biomass without oxygen
    - there is no breakdown of biomass → no degassing noticed so far through sensors under ground
- Optimized variables for algae growth
    - temperature, point of injection of water, when to add, how much to add, velocity of adding, how deep are ponds etc.

- flows into operational model → working with seawater chemistry

Infrastructure and Engineering
- what not to do and discover room for improvement
    - pond depth is too shallow
    - learning rate of large infrastructure project: modularity – not hoping to build plants larger than 12500 sqm anymore
    - will be deeper than today but not larger than that
    - ability to do research at current scale is very transferable from a scaleup point of view
- size matters mostly for seawater intake system
    - current pipeline has real physical limitations (intake, fowling, etc.) → cannot scale this pipeline system to 100s of thousands, millions of tons → engineering money is crazy high
    - modular thinking applies  to seawater intake
